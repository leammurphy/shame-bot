# shame-bot

## Description

This project began as a simple music player and grew into what it is now. This bot was built for my friends and my personal use in our discord channel. This was also a great way to better learn python.

## Main Features

1. ### Art Generation

    > As a way to bring my personal interest of art generation directly to my friends I used the Stability_AI API which enables users to generate art based the prompt they enter.

    #### **Demo**

2. ### Chat Bot

    > The bot can respond to your messages like a human could. Currently, the bot will respond in a similar way the character Zuko would as I used the transcripts from Avatar The Last Airbender on a pretrained model. 

    #### **Demo**

4. ### Quotes and Jokes

    > Sometimes we need to be inspired and sometimes we just need to laugh. Using the zenquotes api returns an inspiring quote and the author. Using a yomama api users can return a yomama joke.

5. ### DVA

    > Everyone likes D.va from the hit game Overwatch... right?  
    This was a sidequest for me to learn webscraping by using the BeautifulSoup library. This feature scrapes pinterest and deviant art for picures of DVA.
